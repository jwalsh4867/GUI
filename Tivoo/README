Tivoo GUI

Time spent researching GUIs was roughly 4 hours. I spent about 3 hours writing the code which i currently have. I tried debugging the code for roughly 8 hours to no avail. I couldn't figure out why the GUI would work, but the panel, menus, mennuitems appear. 

certain directories wouldn't add to github. it kepis saying fatal: CRLF would be replaced by LF

For this reason i added a .zip of my project
